# ðŸ“¸ Static webhosting, URL generation, content moderation using S3, Lambda & AWS Rekognition

### Goal of this project:
- Host a static website on S3 and allow users to upload their images
- Prevent inappropriate images from being processed using AWS Rekognition
- Send and receive API requests along with renaming the images using Lambda
- Save the processed images in another S3 and return their public URL

#
### The Contents:
- Head to the website hosted on S3 and click Browse
- Once you choose an image, click Upload File
- Rekognition will analyze the image
- If the image passes the check, Lambda will rename it (to avoid any naming conflicts)
- Lambdaâ€™s logic was written in python.
- You will then receive a text stating  Your Public URL is Ready
- Click the text to receive your imageâ€™s public URL (the image will be saved in another S3 bucket)

- However if Rekognition detects any illicit material, an error image will occur and the image wonâ€™t be uploaded.
